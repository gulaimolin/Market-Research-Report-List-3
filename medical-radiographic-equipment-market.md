<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Radiographic Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CR Technology</li><li>DR Technology</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Medical radiographic equipment market is divided into two main types: CR (computed radiography) technology and DR (digital radiography) technology. CR technology uses imaging plates to capture X-ray images, which are then processed digitally. DR technology, on the other hand, directly captures X-ray images using detectors and converts them into digital images without the need for processing. Both types offer advantages such as faster image acquisition, better image quality, and lower radiation exposure compared to traditional film-based radiography.</p></p>
