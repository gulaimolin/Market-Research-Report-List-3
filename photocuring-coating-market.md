<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photocuring Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-Based Paint</li><li>Solvent-Based Paint</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Photocuring coatings are available in two main types: water-based paint and solvent-based paint. Water-based paint is popular due to its environmentally friendly nature, as it contains fewer harmful chemicals and emits lower levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). On the other hand, solvent-based paint offers faster drying times and better adhesion to surfaces, making it ideal for tough industrial applications. Both types of coatings utilize photocuring technology to cure and harden upon exposure to ultraviolet or visible light.</p></p>
