<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The MEMS RF Switches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shunt Switch</li><li>Series Switch</li></ul></p>
<p><p>MEMS RF switches are categorized into two main types: Shunt switches and Series switches. Shunt switches route RF signals through a parallel path when activated, effectively shunting the signal to ground when not in use. Series switches, on the other hand, route the RF signal through the switch itself when activated, allowing the signal to pass through the switch when needed. Both types of switches are used in RF applications to control the flow of signals in communication devices and systems.</p></p>
