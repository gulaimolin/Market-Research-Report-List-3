<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Foundry Cheromite Sand Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Level 1 Cr2O3 ≥45%</li><li>Level 2 Cr2O3≥35%</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Foundry chromite sand is categorized into three main types based on the chromium oxide (Cr2O3) content. Level 1 chromite sand has a Cr2O3 content of ≥45%, making it the highest quality and most effective for foundry applications. Level 2 chromite sand has a Cr2O3 content of ≥35%, offering good quality but slightly lower performance compared to Level 1. The "Other" market includes chromite sand with varying Cr2O3 content below 35%, which may be suitable for certain foundry processes but are not as high in quality as Level 1 and Level 2 chromite sand.</p></p>
