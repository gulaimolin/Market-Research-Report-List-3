<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heavy-duty Vehicle Engine Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Compression Release Brake</li><li>Exhaust Brake</li><li>Retarder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heavy-duty vehicle engine brake market includes three main types: compression release brake, exhaust brake, and retarder. Compression release brake works by releasing compressed air from the cylinder during the exhaust stroke, creating resistance and slowing down the vehicle. Exhaust brake restricts the flow of exhaust gases, creating back pressure and helping to slow down the vehicle. Retarder uses hydraulic resistance to slow down the vehicle by absorbing its kinetic energy. Each type offers unique advantages for managing speed and improving overall vehicle performance.</p></p>
