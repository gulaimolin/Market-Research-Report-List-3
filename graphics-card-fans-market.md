<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Graphics Card Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Fans</li><li>Centrifugal Fans</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Graphics card fans come in two main types: axial fans and centrifugal fans. Axial fans, the most common type, pull air from the front of the fan and exhaust it out the back, providing efficient cooling for the GPU. Centrifugal fans, on the other hand, draw air into the fan and then push it out at a 90-degree angle, making them more powerful and suitable for compact spaces. Both types of fans have their own market in the graphics card industry, serving different needs and preferences of consumers.</p></p>
