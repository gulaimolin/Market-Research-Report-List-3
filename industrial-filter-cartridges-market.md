<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Filter Cartridges Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Depth-type Filter Cartridges</li><li>Surface-type Filter Cartridges</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial filter cartridges are used in various industries to remove impurities and contaminants from liquids or gases. There are two main types of filter cartridges: depth-type and surface-type. Depth-type filter cartridges have a thick filtration media that captures contaminants throughout the entire depth of the cartridge. Surface-type filter cartridges have a thin layer of filtration media that captures contaminants on the surface of the cartridge. Both types are effective in filtering out impurities, but depth-type cartridges are typically used for larger particles, while surface-type cartridges are used for finer filtration.</p></p>
