<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Graphitic Cathode Block Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bottom Block</li><li>Side Block</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Graphitic cathode blocks are used in the ferroalloy industry for molten metal production. There are two main types of these blocks: bottom blocks and side blocks. Bottom blocks are used at the bottom of the furnace, while side blocks are used on the sides. Bottom blocks are often larger and more durable, as they withstand higher temperatures and more pressure. Side blocks are smaller and provide support to the furnace lining. Both types play a crucial role in maintaining the stability and efficiency of the furnace operation.</p></p>
