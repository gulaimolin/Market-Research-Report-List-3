<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The TIG Guns Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Cooled</li><li>Air Cooled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>TIG guns are welding torches used in Tungsten Inert Gas welding. They come in two main types: water-cooled and air-cooled. Water-cooled TIG guns use circulating water to regulate the temperature of the torch, allowing for longer periods of continuous welding without overheating. Air-cooled TIG guns, on the other hand, rely on air flow to cool the torch and are generally more lightweight and portable. Both types have their advantages and are chosen based on the specific welding needs of the user.</p></p>
