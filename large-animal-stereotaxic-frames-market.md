<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Large Animal Stereotaxic Frames Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Arm</li><li>Dual-Arm</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Large Animal Stereotaxic Frames are available in two main types: Single-Arm and Dual-Arm. Single-Arm frames typically have a single support arm for positioning and securing the animal during procedures. Dual-Arm frames, on the other hand, have two support arms that offer greater stability and flexibility in positioning. Both types of frames are used for precise and controlled manipulation of instruments in large animal research, but Dual-Arm frames provide enhanced accuracy and control due to their additional support arm.</p></p>
