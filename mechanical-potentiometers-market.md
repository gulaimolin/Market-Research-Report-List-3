<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Potentiometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Through Hole Potentiometers</li><li>SMD Potentiometers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Through Hole Potentiometers are mounted onto a printed circuit board by inserting leads through pre-drilled holes and soldering them in place. This type of potentiometer is commonly used in applications where stability and durability are important.</p><p>SMD Potentiometers, on the other hand, are surface-mount devices that are soldered directly onto the surface of a circuit board. They are smaller in size and offer more design flexibility compared to Through Hole Potentiometers. SMD Potentiometers are widely used in compact electronic devices where space is limited.</p></p>
