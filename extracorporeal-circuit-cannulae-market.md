<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Extracorporeal Circuit Cannulae Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Arterial Cannulae</li><li>Venous Cannulae</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Extracorporeal circuit cannulae are essential components of cardiopulmonary bypass systems used during surgeries to support heart and lung function. Arterial cannulae are inserted into an artery to carry oxygenated blood from the bypass machine to the body, while venous cannulae are inserted into a vein to return deoxygenated blood back to the machine for oxygenation. Both types of cannulae play a critical role in maintaining circulation and oxygenation during cardiac procedures.</p></p>
