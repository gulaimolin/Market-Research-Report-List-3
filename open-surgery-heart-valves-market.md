<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Open Surgery Heart Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Valves</li><li>TAVR Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Open surgery heart valves refer to procedures where the chest is opened to access the heart for valve replacement. Mechanical valves are durable but require lifelong blood thinners. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) valves are a minimally invasive alternative to open surgery, where the new valve is inserted through a catheter. TAVR valves are typically used for high-risk patients or those who cannot undergo open surgery. Both mechanical and TAVR valves offer options for treating heart valve conditions, each with its own benefits and considerations.</p></p>
