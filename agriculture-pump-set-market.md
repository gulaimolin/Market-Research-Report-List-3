<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agriculture Pump Set Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Pumps</li><li>Displacement Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Agriculture pump sets can be classified into two main types: centrifugal pumps and displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps work by using centrifugal force to generate pressure and move fluid through the system, making them ideal for applications where high flow rates are required. Displacement pumps, on the other hand, operate by trapping fluid in a chamber and then displacing it through the system, making them better suited for applications requiring higher pressure output. Both types of pumps play a crucial role in the agricultural sector for irrigation, water transfer, and other applications.</p></p>
