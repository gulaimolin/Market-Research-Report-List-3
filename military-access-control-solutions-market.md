<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Military Access Control Solutions Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Discretionary Access Control</li><li>Mandatory Access Control</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Military Access Control Solutions are crucial for ensuring the security of military installations. Discretionary Access Control allows users to determine who can access specific resources based on their access levels, providing flexibility but potentially leading to security risks. Mandatory Access Control, on the other hand, is more rigid and centrally managed, where access permissions are defined by system administrators, ensuring a higher level of security but less flexibility for individual users. Both solutions play a vital role in safeguarding sensitive military information and assets.</p></p>
