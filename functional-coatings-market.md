<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Functional Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Powder Coating</li><li>E-Coat</li><li>Plating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Functional coatings are specialized coatings designed to provide specific properties to a substrate. There are three main types of functional coatings in the market - powder coating, e-coat, and plating. </p><p>Powder coating involves applying a dry powder to a substrate, which is then cured to form a durable finish. E-coat, or electrocoating, uses an electrical current to deposit a uniform coating on a conductive substrate. Plating involves electrochemical methods to deposit a thin metal coating onto a substrate for enhanced properties such as corrosion resistance.</p></p>
