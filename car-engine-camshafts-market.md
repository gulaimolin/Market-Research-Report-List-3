<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Car Engine Camshafts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flat-tappet Cams (Bottom)</li><li>Roller Cams (Top)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flat-tappet cams are the traditional type of camshafts commonly found in older car engines. They feature a flat surface on the follower that moves along the cam lobe. Roller cams, on the other hand, have a roller on the follower which reduces friction and wear on the camshaft. Roller cams are more efficient and durable than flat-tappet cams. Both types have their advantages and disadvantages, with roller cams being more popular in modern engines due to their superior performance and longevity.</p></p>
