<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rat Isolator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Pressure Isolator</li><li>Negative Pressure Isolator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rat isolators are used in research settings to provide a controlled environment for rats, preventing contamination and maintaining a sterile atmosphere. Positive pressure isolators work by pushing clean, filtered air into the enclosure, keeping pathogens out. Negative pressure isolators, on the other hand, suck air out of the enclosure to prevent contaminants from escaping. Both types of isolators play a crucial role in maintaining the health and safety of research animals and ensuring the reliability of experimental results.</p></p>
